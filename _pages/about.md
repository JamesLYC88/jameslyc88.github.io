- Second-year Master's student in [Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu).
- Focused on applied machine learning, particularly in search and recommendation systems, with internship experience at Adobe Search and Microsoft Bing Advertising.
- Conducted NLP research at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) and [ASUS-AICS](https://aics.asus.com). My work [Linear Classifier: An Often-Forgotten Baseline for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07111) has won ACL Outstanding Paper Award.
- Contributor to [LibMultiLabel](https://github.com/ASUS-AICS/LibMultiLabel), a library for multi-class and multi-label classification.

Projects
======
- Efficiency Boost in LLM Training via CuPy and FP16  
  Utilized CuPy for GPU arrays and enabled mixed precision training with MiniTorch for LLM development.
- [Minimal Version of Sora](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/16-726-sp24/projects/ylin7/project/)  
  Implemented with CLIP text encoder, diffusion transformer, DDIM scheduler, and classifier-free guidance.
- [A Baseline for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07111)  
  Concluded simple linear baselines must be conducted to ensure the proper use of the advanced LLMs.
